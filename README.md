# To-Do List App

## Overview
The To-Do List App is a simple iOS application that allows users to manage a list of tasks. Users can add, modify, and delete items from the list. Each task includes a title, completion status, due date, and notes. The app persists data between launches, ensuring that users' tasks are always saved and retrievable.
